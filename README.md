# Quantifying Generalizability of Vision Language Navigation Models using Vagueness of Language Instructions
The repo contains reference files and instructions on the analysis of Vsion Language Navigation Models on the terms of language instruction vagueness which has been hypothesised to cause loss of generalizibility in these models. This repo is trying to propose a benchmark for the above mentioned vagueness metric.
